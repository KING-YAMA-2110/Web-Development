                <h3>Road Transport: Innovations in Light-Duty Vehicles</h3>
                <p>Road transport, especially private cars, is the primary passenger travel mode, accounting for three-quarters of all passenger journeys. Over the past 20 years, four technologies have emerged to reduce carbon emissions from light-duty vehicles: ultra-efficient internal combustion engines, biofuels, hydrogen, and electric power. For example, ultra-efficient engines use advanced designs to reduce fuel consumption...</p>
